			<Abstract type="html">The CrashlyticsDelegate protocol provides a mechanism for your application to take
action on events that occur in the Crashlytics crash reporting system.  You can make
use of these calls by assigning an object to the Crashlytics&apos; delegate property directly,
or through the convenience startWithAPIKey:delegate:... methods.</Abstract>

			<Abstract type="html">Called once a Crashlytics instance has determined that the last execution of the
application ended in a crash.  This is called some time after the crash reporting
process has begun.  If you have specified a delay in one of the
startWithAPIKey:... calls, this will take at least that long to be invoked.</Abstract>

			<Abstract type="html">Just like crashlyticsDidDetectCrashDuringPreviousExecution this delegate method is
called once a Crashlytics instance has determined that the last execution of the
application ended in a crash. A CLSCrashReport is passed back that contains data about
the last crash report that was generated. See the CLSCrashReport protocol for method details.
This method is called after crashlyticsDidDetectCrashDuringPreviousExecution.</Abstract>
